			<h3>What's in a (Chinese) Name?</h3>
			<p>
			In English, names are used as identifiers. They can have some convoluted meanings attached
			to them (e.g., "Isabella" is the Italian translation of
			"God is my oath"), but for the most part, they simply serve as identifiers. 
			<br><br>
			In Chinese, names are more than that. Not only do they serve as personal identifiers, 
			but each and every name also means something that every Chinese person is aware of. 
			This is because in Chinese, names are made up of real words/characters.
			<br><br>
			An example of a Chinese name is: 马绍恩. The structure is [Family Name (马)] 
			[Given Name (绍恩)]. The family name is inherited from the patriarch of a family, 
			passed down through generations. 
			It is usually a single character, but a few consist of two.
			<br><br>
			The given name is chosen at birth as an individual’s personal identifier. 
			It can consist of one or two characters. Usually, if a name has two characters, 
			the second character is the "generation name", with siblings of a family sharing 
			the same character (绍 in the example). If a person's given name is only a single character, 
			it may indicate that they are an only child. However, this is only a guideline, 
			and parents may name their only child a two character name if they 
			prefer the meaning of the name with two characters.
			<br><br>
			In the example name above, "马" (surname) means "horse", "绍" (first character of given) 
			means "to continue/carry on", and "恩" (second character of given) means "grace/kindness".
			<br><br>
			Because Chinese names have such meanings, naming requires great care. People tend to want to give names with 
			pleasant meanings, eliminating vulgar and negative words from the naming vocabulary. 
			Some parents even wish to bestow a “good” name because Chinese 
			superstition suggests that a name can determine one’s fate in life.
			As such, names encode the wishes parents have for their children. 
			So, you might be wondering, what are these wishes? We sought to uncover 
			more about this relationship with the following data visualization, and we 
			discovered that names, and their associated sentiments, 
			change with the times and the gender of a newborn.
			</p>
			<h3>Important Notes</h3>
			<p>Now, before we dive into exploring Chinese names throughout modern history, let us first note some important information.
			Our data is collected from Han Chinese in the People’s Republic of China (Mainland China). The names are split into 6 cohorts—pre-1960, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Before 1960, the names are for people who were alive. After, they are for all newborns in that decade.
			The data shows unique aspects of Mainland China’s historical context, events, and culture. Naming practices in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, and Chinese Diaspora, as well as non-Han ethnic groups in Mainland China are not reflected.
			</p>
			<p>
			In addition to the dataset, we did some additional work to make the data more accessible. First, we translated more that 500+ individual names by hand and catagorised them into themes. Then, to verify validity, two members of the team cross checked each other's translations and catagorisation.
			Every Chinese character is very rich in meaning and nuance, but we did our very best to convey them in English. We hope the translations will be insighful and interesting to you!

		<h4>The Visualisation</h4>
		<svg id="decade-rank-m"></svg><svg id="decade-rank-f"></svg>
		<p>Let's look at the top 100 names of each decade for each gender. This visualisation ranks each name vertically by decade, and tracks how its rank changes using a line. Each name is labelled at its peak ranking. You can hover your mouse over the labels and lines and see the meaning on the right. The colours represent the "theme" of the name. You can filter the themes by clicking on the squares on the right.
			Right now this looks very complicated, so let's investigate some of the main themes!</p>

		<h3>pre-1960</h3>
		<p>
		The years before the 1960's was characterised by revolutions and poverty. If you were born during the Boxer Rebellion (1900), you would experience the fall of China's last imperial
		dynasty (1911), the internal division and constant civil war of the Warlord Era (1912-1927), the partial unification by the Nationalists (1927), the creation of puppet states in the northwest by Japan (1931), and then a full invasion marking the start of World War II (1937).
		After the end of World War II, you would see a new Civil War erupt between the Nationalists and the Communists, leading to a Communist victory on the Mainland and the retreat of the Nationalists to Taiwan.
		You would have experienced Mao Zedong (毛泽东) proclaim the People’s Republic in Tiananmen Square and, finally, an end to civil war. 
		You would experience a series of collectivising reforms, but some, like the Great Leap Forward (1958), would lead to a famine that ultimately kills 15-55 million people (1959-1961).
		</p>
		<p>
		To say the people of China suffered greatly during this period would be an understatement. In addition to the death and suffering caused by civil wars and external invasion, China would experience 6 separate famines from 1900-1960. 
		The Zeitgeist of this era was very much a desire to see a better China. The parents named their children in hopes that they would grow up to live in, or to help build a peaceful, stable, and prosperous nation to live in.

		<h5>Names about Nation/National Recovery</h5>
		<div>
		<svg id="decade-rank-m-nation" class="pairDisp"></svg>
		<svg id="decade-rank-f-nation" class="pairDisp"></svg></div>
		<p>Reflecting Gender attitudes at the time, female children were less expected to be concerned with affairs of the state, and hence it was much less common for female names to be about the country.</p>

		<h3>1960s and 1970s</h3>
		<p>
		The Great Chinese famine ended in 1961, and Mao's leadership took a back seat due to the failure of the Great Leap Forward.
		Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Premier Zhou Enlai took over direction of the country and adopted more pragmatic economic policies.
		Dissatisfied, Mao aimed to regain his preemience by launching the Cultural Revolution. This mass social movement aimed to return Communism and Maoism as the dominant ideology.
		A key idea of this movement was that the chaos and suffering of the previous decades was due to the flaws and weaknesses of tradition. To strengthen the nation, the country must
		cast away the past and agressively modernise into a Communist state. 
		As such, names relating to Communism and the Military became popular in this era. 
		In the mid-1970s, Deng Xiaoping would begin some limited economic reforms.
		The Cultural Revolution will continue until the Death of Mao. after which there would official repudiation of the Cultural Revolution and the reduction of ideological fervour of the population.

		<h3>1980s</h3>
		<p>
		The 1980s in China was a period of Reform. The collectivising policies instituded in the previous decades were dismantled (1979-1982), and private enterprises were allowed (1985).
		The "One Child Policy" (1979) was just introduced, and its effects can be seen in this decade and after. In 3 character Chinese names, the second character usually represents the "generation", with
		sibling of the same generation sharing the same second character. Since the new policy meant that only childs became more common, many parents chose to not give a generation name to their child, leading to single character names becoming popular.

		<h3>1990s to 2000s</h3>
		<p>
		Deng's economic reforms during the 1980's bore fruit and resulted in massive economic growth, stability and prosperity for Chinese people. Parents of this era were no longer so concerned with ideology and national stability, and were more able to focus on their child's well being.
		In this era, you see more names relating to Happiness and Family, as well as more of a focus onto Intelligence.
		Gradual improvements in gender attitudes can also be seen, as the names relating to Intelligence increases for both genders.
