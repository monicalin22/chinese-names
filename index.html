			<h3>What's in a (Chinese) Name?</h3>
			<p>
			In English, names are used as identifiers. They can have some convoluted meanings attached
			to them (e.g., "Isabella" is the Spanish/Italian translation of
			"God is my oath"), but for the most part, they simply serve as identifiers. 
			<br><br>
			In Chinese, names are more than that. Not only do they serve as personal identifiers, 
			but each name also means something that every Chinese person is aware of  
			because in Chinese, names are made up of words/characters.
			<br><br>
			An example of a Chinese name is: 马绍恩. The structure is [Family Name (马)] 
			[Given Name (绍恩)]. The family name is inherited from the patriarch of a family, 
			passed down through generations. It usually consists of a single character, but 
			a small number consist of two.
			<br><br>
			The given name is chosen at birth as an individual’s personal identifier. 
			It can consist of one or two characters. Usually, if a name has two characters, 
			the second is the "generation name", which siblings of a family share 
			(绍 in the example above). If a person's given name is only a single character, 
			it may indicate that they are an only child, but parents 
			might still give their only child a two-character name if they 
			prefer the meaning of it.
			<br><br>
			In the example name above, "马" means "horse", "绍" means "to continue/carry on", 
			and "恩" means "grace/kindness"; (family name, first character of given 
			name, and second character of given name respectively.) This specific name was intended to have
			Christian undertones, as the parents had just converted to Christianity when this person was born.
			<br><br>
			<b>Because Chinese names have such meanings, naming requires great care.
			Parents tend to want to give names with pleasant meanings, eliminating vulgar and negative words from 
			the naming vocabulary. Some parents even wish to bestow a “good” name because Chinese 
			superstition suggests that a name can determine one’s fate in life.
			As such, names encode the wishes parents have for their children. </b>
			So, what are these wishes? To uncover more about this relationship, 
			we created the data visualizations below. We discovered that names and 
			their associated sentiments change depending on the gender of a newborn and 
			the historical period in which they were born.
			<br><br>
			This article showcases an overview of general trends in Chinese naming practices, 
			but by no means does it represent the general experience of the Chinese people. 
			When giving names to their newborn children, parents have an infinite amount of 
			possible combinations to choose from. When settling on that final name, they 
			have most likely selected something that embodies their unique and individual 
			experiences and, as a result, hopes for their child. As such, the history and 
			meanings shared below were experienced differently by each and every parent.
			</p>
			<h3>Important Notes</h3>
			<p>Before we dive into exploring Chinese names throughout modern history, 
			we must share a few important notes about our work.
			The data represents only Han Chinese names from the People’s Republic of China 
			(Mainland China). The names are split into 6 cohorts: pre-1960, 1960s, 1970s, 
			1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The pre-1960 names are of those who were alive at the time, 
			and after that, they are of all newborns in a given decade.
			The data contains unique aspects of Mainland China’s historical context, events, and 
			culture, but naming practices in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, the Chinese Diaspora, 
			and non-Han ethnic groups in Mainland China are not reflected.
			<br><br>
			Additionally, we did some work to make the data more accessible. 
			First, we translated 500+ individual names by hand and catagorized them into themes. 
			Then, to verify validity, two members of the team cross-checked one another's translations and 
			categorization. Though every Chinese character is very rich in meaning and nuance, we did 
			our very best to convey them in English. We hope that the translations will be insightful 
			and interesting to you!
			</p>
			<h4 id="beg-of-history">The Impact of Modern History on Chinese Names</h4>
			<p>
			The characters of Chinese names were impacted by the historical contexts 
			during which they were given, and our first visualizations take a deeper look 
			at this relationship between history and given names.<br><br>
			First, we present a breakdown of historical periods in China from pre-1960s to the 2000s, 
			and break down the most important takeways of our main visualization for this section. <br><br>
			Then, we present that visualization with an accompanying caption describing how to 
			read and interact with it. (If you would like to see that visualization now, <a class="link" 
			href="#text-container-brian-viz"> please click here.</a> You can always scroll up 
			to read through the history after.)
			</p>
		<h3>&#8212 Before 1960</h3>
		<p>
			<b>The years before the 1960s were characterized by revolution, poverty, and instability.</b><br><br>
			If you were born during this period, you would have experienced the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, the 
			fall of China's 
			last imperial dynasty in 1911, the internal division and constant civil war of the Warlord Era 
			from 1912 to 1927, a partial unification by Nationalists in 1927, the creation of puppet 
			states in the northwest by Japan in 1931, and a brutal, full-scale invasian by Japan 
			that marked the start of World War II for China in 1937. After World War II ended, 
			you would have experienced the eruption of a civil war 
			between the Nationalists and the Communists, which saw the Communists win on the Mainland, pushing 
			the Nationalists to retreat to Taiwan. You would have also witnessed Mao Zedong (毛泽东) proclaim 
			the People's Republic in Tiananmen Square, bringing about the end of a civil war but a more 
			tumultuous future.
			Under Mao, you would have experienced a series of collectivizing reforms, 
			but some, like the Great Leap Forward (1958), led to a famine that ultimately killed 
			an estimated 15 to 55 
			million people from 1959 to 1961.<br><br>
			To say the people of China suffered greatly during this period would be an understatement. 
			In addition to the death and suffering caused by civil wars and external invasion, 
			China experienced 6 separate famines from 1900-1960. <br><br>
			<b>The zeitgest of this era was very much a desire to see a better China as the one that parents 
			knew was desolate and riddled with hardship. As such, parents named their children in the hope that 
			they would grow up in and help build a more peaceful, stable, and prosperous China.</b>

			<h3>&#8212 The 1960s and 1970s</h3>
			<p>In 1961, the Great Chinese Famine ended, and Mao's leadership took a backseat 
				due to the failure of the Great Leap Forward. Political leaders Liu Shaoqi (刘少奇), 
				Deng Xiaoping (邓小平), and Premier Zhou Enlai (周恩来) laid a heavier hand in 
				directing the country, adopting more pragmatic and open economic policies. <br><br>
				Dissatisfied, Mao attempted to regain his preeminence by launching the Cultural Revolution 
				in 1966. This mass social movement aimed to reinstate Communism/Maoism as the dominant 
				ideology. A key idea of this movement was that the chaos and suffering 
				of previous decades could be attributed to the flaws and weaknesses of "tradition";  
				To strengthen the nation, the country must cast away the past, often violently, 
				and aggressively modernize into a Communist state.<br><br>
				<b>As a result, names related to Communism, such those including the color red and those 
				related to military terminology, became rather popular during this era.</b><br><br>
				In the mid-1970s, Deng Xiaopeng brought about some limited economic reforms, but the 
				Cultural Revolution continued until the death of Mao in 1976. Afterwards came an 
				official repudiation of the Cultural Revolution and its ideals, as well as a 
				reduction of ideological fervor among the individuals of Mainland China.

			During the 1960s and 1970s, names related to military terminology became

			gender attitudes of the time as military matters were seen as masculine. There was 
			an increase in popularity, though, for names containing the word, "red." (Red is a color 
			closely associated with Communism, and the main color of the flag that was 
			raised when the People's Republic of China was established.)

			<h3>&#8212 The 1980s</h3>
			<p>In China, the 1980s was a decade of reform. 
				The collectivizing policies instituted in previous decades 
				were dismantled between 1979 and 1982. In 1985, private enterprises were 
				allowed to form. <br><br>
				The "One Child Policy" was just introduced in 1979, and its effects were most pertinent 
				in this decade and the decades after. As mentioned in the introduction, in Chinese names 
				with three characters, the second is the "generation name", with siblings of the same 
				generation sharing that same second character. <b>The new policy meant that parents could 
				only have a single child, so many parents chose not to give a generation name, resulting in 
				the rise of single-character names.</b>

				<b>As such, parents of this era were no longer as concerned with ideology and 
					national stability; rather, they focused more on their child's well-being and future. 
					This resulted in more names relating to "Intelligence", "Joy & Happiness", and "Family".

			<h4>Warmth & Competence and Gender Attitudes</h4>
			<p>
				We have now seen that names can reveal information about the historical events parents have 
				experienced, but what else can we learn from names? Well, because Chinese names are 
				composed of real words, they can also teach us about the emotions they are meant to evoke. 
				Our <a class="link" href=https://github.com/psychbruce/ChineseNames target=_blank>data source</a> 
				can help us with this, as it gives 
				three attributes/values to quantify the feelings each character may evoke: valence, warmth, and 
				competence. In the following visualization, we explore the warmth and competence of the top 50 
				characters found in both female and male names from the 1950s to 2000s.
				<br><br>
				First, what are “warmth” and “competence,” according to a research paper titled, <a class="link"
				href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167218769858" target=_blank>“Name Norms: 
				A Guide to Casting Your Next Experiment”</a>, when meeting others for the first 
				time, people’s impressions are affected by two aspects: warmth and competence. <b>Warmth can 
				be characterized by traits such as friendliness, honesty, kindness, sincerity, reliability, and morality. 
				Competence can be characterized by traits such as cleverness, carefulness, efficiency, creativity, 
				knowledgeability, persistence, and intelligence.</b>
				<br><br>
				How, then, were these values formatted? The creators of the data source asked 10 Chinese 
				people (5 female) to rate Chinese names. They were given names of people, instructed to 
				imagine meeting them, and then asked to judge how likely, on a scale from 1 to 5, they would 
				perceive this person as either warm or competent? These raters mainly utilized their preexisting 
				knowledge of the characters in the names and their own intuition. <b>As such, It is important to 
				note that these ratings are subjective. </b>

		</div>

		<p class="caption">In general, the top 50 characters in the given names of each decade 
			display above-average warmth and competence, regardless of gender. This may be because 
			of the significance of naming children, so parents would never want give their child a 
			name that is vulgar or negative.<br><br>
			Additionally, the average warmth and competence of given names 
			increases in parts per million throughout the decades, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. 
			(Parts per million is just the normalized value/absolute number of how many people 
			have the character in their name; you can think of it as similar to popularity, but not the exact same.)
			This change can be explained in our analysis of this 
			era as names related to "Joy & Happiness", "Family", and "Intelligence" increased in 
			popularity. These kinds of names definitely contain words that are warmer/more competent.
			<br><br>
			Finally, though average warmth of given characters among male and female newborns stays 
			relatively similar throughout the decades, on average, characters given to males for 
			their names are more competent. The gap increases for average competence between male and 
			female names in the 1990s and 2000s, displaying some biases towards gender, i.e. that 
			parents had higher hopes for the competence of male children.<br><br>
			(Note: Here, 1950 refers to pre-1960s, and the average lines in each decade 
			are calculated for all 50 characters in that decade, regardless of how many 
			you decide to display in the visualizations.)</p>

			<p>
				A Chinese name can tell us when a child was born, what their parents have 
				experienced, how their parents have felt, and what their parents wished for 
				their child's future. <br><br>
				In moments of bleakness, such as in the 1960s and 1970s, parents faced many trials and 
				tribulations because of Mao Zedong's attempts to again seize power, so they hoped that their children 
				would grow up to see a better, kinder, more hospitable nation. 
				In moments of hope, such as the 1990s and 2000s, new parents, who were the children of previous decades, 
				dared to dream and live happily again in a reformed China brought about by Deng Xiaopeng. 
				As a result, parents bestowed upon their children hopes of intellect, 
				joy, and family, which was reflected in their given names.<br><br>
				A name, then, is not just a name. Rather, it is a culmination of not only a country's history, but 
				also one's familial history that is composed of experienced spanning hundreds of years and generations.

				<b>Introduction</b><br>
					&emsp; Our group consists of 4 members who all have Han Chinese heritage, so looking through the 
					dataset, we understood the definitions of isolated characters and wondered why our parents named 
					us the way they did. More generally, we wondered: “What influences a Chinese name?” <br> 
					&emsp; One obvious answer was gender, a deciding factor in most cultures. Other 
					potential influences included history and parents’ wishes for their children, i.e. 
					naming a child a word meaning “smart” might mean that they wanted their child to grow up smarter.<br>
					&emsp; We realized that Chinese names are rich with meaning and information, so we were 
					eager to learn more about the people of Mainland China, the times they lived through, and their hopes for 
					the future, all through the names they gave their children.
					<br><br>
				<b>Related Work</b><br>
					We found found an article, <a class="wu-link" href=
					"(https://kontinentalist.com/stories/a-cultural-history-of-han-chinese-names-for-girls-and-boys-in-china" 
					target=_blank>“What can we tell from the evolution 
					of Han Chinese names?”</a>, that gave us an initial understanding of 
					modern history in China and Han Chinese Names.<br>
					&emsp; Finally, we also learned more about modern Chinese history from <a class="wu-link" href=
					"https://faculty.washington.edu/stevehar/timeframe.html" target=_blank>this source by the University of Washington</a>.
					<br><br>
				<b>Methodology</b><br>
					&emsp; The <a class="wu-link" href="https://github.com/psychbruce/ChineseNames" 
					target=_blank>dataset</a> consists of Chinese surnames and given names separated into 6 
					time periods: pre-1960s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. It contains 
					nationwide frequency statistics of 1,806 Chinese surnames and 2,614 Chinese characters used 
					in given names, covering about 1.2 billion Han Chinese people. <u>We focus on given 
					names</u>, specifically, the top 100 given names per decade (first visualization) 
					and the top 50 most popular characters in any given name decade (all other 
					visualizations). This data source also has information on qualities of Chinese names, such as 
					warmth and competence, which we used in our third visualization.<br>
					&emsp; The data was already cleaned, but we wanted to find English translations for 
					characters and discovered <a class="wu-link" href="http://hanzidb.org/character-list" target=_blank>an API</a>. 
					Since Chinese names have more nuance and meaning than the API could provide, 
					for the top 100 given names per decade used in our first visualization, Brian and Yu-Ying, 
					who are native Mandarin speakers, translated 500+ characters by hand and categorized them by theme.<br>
					&emsp; We utilized prior knowledge of JS to upload data, and we coded 
					the visualizations ourselves, taking inspiration from our motivations  
					and class lectures, but not existing algorithms.
					<br><br>
				<b>Design</b><br>
					&emsp; For our first visualization, we encoded decade as horizontal positioning 
					and the ranking of the given name as vertical positioning, giving the viewer a lot of 
					information effectively. Because the chart is complex, encoding themes of meanings as color can 
					help the user see more general trends, which is vital to connecting it with historical context. 
					Hovering over each name shows the user its meaning; including each meaning in the main 
					visualization itself would have been far too overwhelming. We originally did not have a way to 
					filter the themes and did not break down the visualization/highlight important takeaways, but these 
					new features made the visualization more understandable, digestible, and interactive.<br>
					&emsp; For our second visualization, we encoded the gender proportion of the name as color 
					and space.<br> 
					&emsp; For our third visualization, we again encoded gender as color and used dots to encode both the 
					average warmth and competence values of each character at once. Including a 
					line of the averages of both metrics offers a baseline for comparison. 
					Offering more information on hover helps uncrowd the visualization, and giving the user 
					customizability of all inputs encourages exploration.<br>
					&emsp; For our final visualization, we highlighted important time periods and 
					labelled them, making it easy for users to see what periods may have affected the name they 
					selected. The visualization is interactive, giving users two different methods for searching up 
					characters in order to cater to both non-Chinese speakers as well.
					<br><br>					
				<b>Implementation</b><br>
					&emsp; As mentioned above, we used an API we found online and hand-translations by team 
					members to translate the Chinese characters in the dataset to appropriate English definitions. 
					We coded a <a class="wu-link" href="files/parser.py">parser in Python</a>
					to automate the translation process and made a JSON mapping of translations. <br>
					&emsp; For loading data, we used JavaScript; this is in the beginning of our “script.js” file. 
					Specifically, we have JavaScript “Promises” that fetches from some URLs stored in GitHub pages. 
					<a class="wu-link" href="https://monicalin22.github.io/chinese-names/data/char_to_definition.json?fbclid=IwAR1t8CZZCd1DiENGbUfKxYLGTz29heCqs41kmdNllROJGE1ANbXoR3c1Q-s" 
					target=_blank>Click here for an example.</a><br>
					&emsp; Finally, for the visualizations, we originally built them in an Observable Notebook using D3, 
					but we switched over to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla JS) as we preferred the aesthetics of 
					our own website. All code is our own, and there are no performance issues that we are aware of.
					<br><br>
				<b>Discussion</b></br>
					&emsp; We believe that our final design is quite successful! Many students came up 
					to us during and after class to compliment our work, especially Chinese and Chinese Americans who relate to the contents of our work.
					In the end, we created visualizations that answered our initial 
					questions, satisfied our motivations, and interwove Chinese names with the influences of modern Chinese history.<br>
					&emsp; We believe there is little-to-no confusion for our final visualizations. We received 
					feedback from previous class sessions that we implemented to curb confusion, 
					i.e. our first visualization was originally condensed/hard-to-follow, but we expanded it and 
					added features to make it easier to read. Some viewers were also initially 
					confused by our second visualization and its main takeaway, but with 
					accompanying captions/text, we hope that this provided more clarity.<br>
					&emsp; Finally, we gleaned insight into the impact of history on the identity and 
					experience of Chinese people. Though we have each heard much about the Cultural Revolution as an 
					event, these visualizations have helped us personalize and individualize historical 
					experiences. Moreover, we learned about the prevalences of our own names, and we believe that 
					other Chinese viewers will feel the same way. For our wider 
					audience, we give an overview of Chinese history, which is often overlooked in 
					American schools. Hopefully, our work piqued their interest in cultures vastly different from theirs.

				<b>Future Work</b><br>
					&emsp; Regarding research, in addition to the general events, 
					we want to research gender history and social history more in-depth. <br>
					&emsp; For our second visualization, we want to create an accompanying visualization that 
					shows the top 50 characters per decade based on which decade was selected, rather than only 
					tracking the survivability of pre-1960s names. <br>
					&emsp; For our last visualization, we want to allow the user to input multiple characters 
					and compare trends of all those selected side-by-side. We also want to make the celebrity 
					names clickable and include more history regarding each celebrity’s name. <br>
					&emsp; Finally, we would like to conduct user tests with people not in our class to 
					get opinions from people who may not be as familiar with our work.<br>
