			<h3>What's in a (Chinese) Name?</h3>
			<p>
			In English, names are used as identifiers. They can have some convoluted meanings attached
			to them (e.g., "Isabella" is the Spanish/Italian translation of
			"God is my oath"), but for the most part, they simply serve as identifiers. 
			<br><br>
			In Chinese, names are more than that. Not only do they serve as personal identifiers, 
			but each name also means something that every Chinese person is aware of  
			because in Chinese, names are made up of words/characters.
			<br><br>
			An example of a Chinese name is: 马绍恩. The structure is [Family Name (马)] 
			[Given Name (绍恩)]. The family name is inherited from the patriarch of a family, 
			passed down through generations. It usually consists of a single character, but 
			a small number consist of two.
			<br><br>
			The given name is chosen at birth as an individual’s personal identifier. 
			It can consist of one or two characters. Usually, if a name has two characters, 
			the second is the "generation name", which siblings of a family share 
			(绍 in the example above). If a person's given name is only a single character, 
			it may indicate that they are an only child, but parents 
			might still give their only child a two-character name if they 
			prefer the meaning of it.
			<br><br>
			In the example name above, "马" means "horse", "绍" means "to continue/carry on", 
			and "恩" means "grace/kindness"; (family name, first character of given 
			name, and second character of given name respectively.) This specific name was intended to have
			Christian undertones, as the parents had just converted to Christianity when this person was born.
			<br><br>
			<b>Because Chinese names have such meanings, naming requires great care.
			Parents tend to want to give names with pleasant meanings, eliminating vulgar and negative words from 
			the naming vocabulary. Some parents even wish to bestow a “good” name because Chinese 
			superstition suggests that a name can determine one’s fate in life.
			As such, names encode the wishes parents have for their children. </b>
			So, what are these wishes? To uncover more about this relationship, 
			we created the data visualizations below. We discovered that names and 
			their associated sentiments change depending on the gender of a newborn and 
			the historical period in which they were born.
			<br><br>
			This article showcases an overview of general trends in Chinese naming practices, 
			but by no means does it represent the general experience of the Chinese people. 
			When giving names to their newborn children, parents have an infinite amount of 
			possible combinations to choose from. When settling on that final name, they 
			have most likely selected something that embodies their unique and individual 
			experiences and, as a result, hopes for their child. As such, the history and 
			meanings shared below were experienced differently by each and every parent.
			</p>
			<h3>Important Notes</h3>
			<p>Before we dive into exploring Chinese names throughout modern history, 
			we must share a few important notes about our work.
			The data represents only Han Chinese names from the People’s Republic of China 
			(Mainland China). The names are split into 6 cohorts: pre-1960, 1960s, 1970s, 
			1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The pre-1960 names are of those who were alive at the time, 
			and after that, they are of all newborns in a given decade.
			The data contains unique aspects of Mainland China’s historical context, events, and 
			culture, but naming practices in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, the Chinese Diaspora, 
			and non-Han ethnic groups in Mainland China are not reflected.
			<br><br>
			Additionally, we did some work to make the data more accessible. 
			First, we translated 500+ individual names by hand and catagorized them into themes. 
			Then, to verify validity, two members of the team cross-checked one another's translations and 
			categorization. Though every Chinese character is very rich in meaning and nuance, we did 
			our very best to convey them in English. We hope that the translations will be insightful 
			and interesting to you!
			</p>
			<h4 id="beg-of-history">The Impact of Modern History on Chinese Names</h4>
			<p>
			The characters of Chinese names were impacted by the historical contexts 
			during which they were given, and our first visualizations take a deeper look 
			at this relationship between history and given names by taking a look at the <b>top 100 most popular names for each decade separated by gender.</b><br><br>
			First, we present a breakdown of historical periods in China from pre-1960s to the 2000s, 
			and break down the most important takeways of our main visualization for this section. <br><br>
			Then, we present that visualization with an accompanying caption describing how to 
			read and interact with it. (If you would like to see that visualization now, <a class="link" 
			href="#text-container-brian-viz"> please click here.</a> You can always scroll up 
			to read through the history after.)
			</p>
		<h3>&#8212 Before 1960</h3>
		<p>
			<b>The years before the 1960s were characterized by revolution, poverty, and instability.</b><br><br>
			If you were born during this period, you would have experienced the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, the 
			fall of China's 
			last imperial dynasty in 1911, the internal division and constant civil war of the Warlord Era 
			from 1912 to 1927, a partial unification by Nationalists in 1927, the creation of puppet 
			states in the northwest by Japan in 1931, and a brutal, full-scale invasian by Japan 
			that marked the start of World War II for China in 1937. After World War II ended, 
			you would have experienced the eruption of a civil war 
			between the Nationalists and the Communists, which saw the Communists win on the Mainland, pushing 
			the Nationalists to retreat to Taiwan. You would have also witnessed Mao Zedong (毛泽东) proclaim 
			the People's Republic in Tiananmen Square, bringing about the end of a civil war but a more 
			tumultuous future.
			Under Mao, you would have experienced a series of collectivizing reforms, 
			but some, like the Great Leap Forward (1958), led to a famine that ultimately killed 
			an estimated 15 to 55 
			million people from 1959 to 1961.<br><br>
			To say the people of China suffered greatly during this period would be an understatement. 
			In addition to the death and suffering caused by civil wars and external invasion, 
			China experienced 6 separate famines from 1900-1960. <br><br>
			<b>The zeitgest of this era was very much a desire to see a better China as the one that parents 
			knew was desolate and riddled with hardship. As such, parents named their children in the hope that 
			they would grow up in and help build a more peaceful, stable, and prosperous China.</b>

			<h3>&#8212 The 1960s and 1970s</h3>
			<p>In 1961, the Great Chinese Famine ended, and Mao's leadership took a backseat 
				due to the failure of the Great Leap Forward. Political leaders Liu Shaoqi (刘少奇), 
				Deng Xiaoping (邓小平), and Premier Zhou Enlai (周恩来) laid a heavier hand in 
				directing the country, adopting more pragmatic and open economic policies. <br><br>
				Dissatisfied, Mao attempted to regain his preeminence by launching the Cultural Revolution 
				in 1966. This mass social movement aimed to reinstate Communism/Maoism as the dominant 
				ideology. A key idea of this movement was that the chaos and suffering 
				of previous decades could be attributed to the flaws and weaknesses of "tradition";  
				To strengthen the nation, the country must cast away the past, often violently, 
				and aggressively modernize into a Communist state.<br><br>
				<b>As a result, names related to Communism, such those including the color red and those 
				related to military terminology, became rather popular during this era.</b><br><br>
				In the mid-1970s, Deng Xiaopeng brought about some limited economic reforms, but the 
				Cultural Revolution continued until the death of Mao in 1976. Afterwards came an 
				official repudiation of the Cultural Revolution and its ideals, as well as a 
				reduction of ideological fervor among the individuals of Mainland China.

			During the 1960s and 1970s, names related to military terminology became 
			especially popular for male newborns. In fact, many made top rankings. <br><br>
			For female newborns, military names were not at all popular, reflecting the 
			gender attitudes of the time as military matters were seen as masculine. There was 
			an increase in popularity, though, for names containing the word, "red." (Red is a color 
			closely associated with Communism, and the main color of the flag that was 
			raised when the People's Republic of China was established.)

			<h3>&#8212 The 1980s</h3>
			<p>In China, the 1980s was a decade of reform. 
				The collectivizing policies instituted in previous decades 
				were dismantled between 1979 and 1982. In 1985, private enterprises were 
				allowed to form. <br><br>
				The "One Child Policy" was just introduced in 1979, and its effects were most pertinent 
				in this decade and the decades after. As mentioned in the introduction, in Chinese names 
				with three characters, the second is the "generation name", with siblings of the same 
				generation sharing that same second character. <b>The new policy meant that parents could 
				only have a single child, so many parents chose not to give a generation name, resulting in 
				the rise of single-character names.</b>

			Additionally, the average warmth and competence of given names 
			increases throughout the decades, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. 
			This change can be explained in our analysis of this

			<h6>Write-Up</h6>
			<p class="write-up">
				<b>Introduction</b><br>
					&emsp; Our group consists of 4 members who all have Chinese heritage, so looking through the 
					dataset, we each had questions. We wondered why certain Chinese names for American 
					celebrities, such as Trump, were picked by Chinese people, and we understood that Chinese 
					names have meanings since we understood the individual characters/words that made them up. 
					As such, our next logical question was: “What influencers Chinese names?” <br> 
					&emsp; One obvious answer was gender, a factor that influences names in all cultures; in 
					Chinese specifically, though, how would gender affect names? Other hypotheses of influences 
					included time periods/history, location/geography, and parents’ wishes for their children, i.e. 
					naming a child a word meaning “smart” might just help them grow up to be smarter. (Given the 
					dataset, we were able to explore all of the aforementioned influences, except 
					location/geography.) <br>
					&emsp; We realized that Chinese names are rich with meaning and information, so we were 
					eager to learn more about the people of China, the times they lived through, and their hopes for 
					the future through the names they gave their children.
					<br><br>
				<b>Related Work</b><br>
					&emsp; There has been some work on visualizing names, such as <a class="wu-link" href=
					"https://pudding.cool/2019/05/hyphens/" target=_blank>The Rise of Hyphenated 
					Last Names in Pro Sports” by <i>The Pudding</i></a> and <a class="wu-link" href=
					"https://www.bewitched.com/namevoyager.html" target=_blank>"The Name Voyager"</a> 
					These gave us some initial ideas into how we could analyze and visualize names.<br>
					&emsp; We also found an article, <a class="wu-link" href=
					"(https://kontinentalist.com/stories/a-cultural-history-of-han-chinese-names-for-girls-and-boys-in-china" 
					target=_blank>“What can we tell from the evolution 
					of Han Chinese names?”</a>, that helped us get an initial understanding of 
					modern history in China, Han Chinese Names, and the relationship between the two.<br>
					&emsp; Finally, we also learned more about modern Chinese history from <a class="wu-link" href=
					"https://faculty.washington.edu/stevehar/timeframe.html" target=_blank>this source by the University of Washington</a>.
					<br><br>
				<b>Methodology</b><br>
					&emsp; The <a class="wu-link" href="https://github.com/psychbruce/ChineseNames" 
					target=_blank>dataset</a> consists of Chinese surnames and given names separated into 6 
					time periods: pre-1960s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s (2000-2008). It contains 
					nationwide frequency statistics of 1,806 Chinese surnames and 2,614 Chinese characters used 
					in given names, covering about 1.2 billion Han Chinese population. <u>We focus on given 
					names.</u> Specifically, we use the top 100 given names per time period (first visualization) 
					and the top 50 most popular characters in any given name per time period (rest of the 
					visualizations). <br>
					&emsp; This data source also has functions for computing qualities of Chinese names, such as 
					warmth and competence, which we used in our third visualization. <i>For more information 
					about the dataset and definitions of warmth and competence, please refer to our main 
					article.</i><br>
					&emsp; The data itself was already clean, but we did have to find English translations for 
					characters through <a class="wu-link" href="http://hanzidb.org/character-list" target=_blank>an online API</a>, which we used 
					for visualizations of the top 50 characters. For the top 100 characters per decade used in our 
					first visualization, two members of our team (Brian & Yu-Ying), who are native Mandarin 
					speakers, translated 500+ characters by hand, categorized them by theme, and cross-checked 
					their translations/categorization. Additionally, we wrote a parser script in Python to make 
					translations easier. Finally, we made a mapping of translations using JSON.<br>
					&emsp; For uploading the data in JavaScript, Jeffrey and Brian utilized prior knowledge and 
					Google queries. For the visualization itself, we coded them by hand and did not really take direct 
					inspiration from any existing algorithms, though we did take inspiration from our initial 
					motivations, related work, and techniques that we learned in class.
					<br><br>
				<b>Design</b><br>
					&emsp; For our first visualization, we encoded decade/time period with horizontal positioning 
					and popularity of the given name with vertical positioning, allowing us to the viewer a lot of 
					information effectively. Because the chart is busy, encoding themes of meanings with color can 
					help the user see more general trends, which is important in lieu of historical context. Hovering 
					over each name allows the user to see its meaning because including each meaning in the main 
					visualization itself would have been far too overwhelming. We originally did not have a way to 
					filter the themes and did not break down the visualization/highlight important takeaways, but by 
					adding these features in, we made the visualization more understandable, digestible, and 
					interactive.<br>
					&emsp; For our second visualization, we encoded the gender proportion of the name as color 
					and space, making it easy for viewers to differentiate female/male popularity of the name.<br> 
					&emsp; For our third visualization, we encoded gender as color and used dots to encode the 
					average warmth and competence values of each character, allowing the viewer to see both 
					values at once. Including a line of the average values for both metrics helps the users compare 
					a single character/dot to a baseline. Offering more information on hover helps uncrowd the 
					visualization, and giving the user customizability of all inputs encourages exploration.<br>
					&emsp; For our final visualization, we highlighted important time periods in a special color and 
					labeled them, making it easy for users to see what period may have affected the name they 
					selected. The visualization is interactive, giving users two different methods for searching up 
					characters, catering to both non-native and native Chinese speakers.
					<br><br>					
				<b>Implementation</b><br>
					&emsp; As mentioned above, we used an API we found online and hand-translations by team 
					members to translate the Chinese characters in the dataset to appropriate English definitions. 
					We coded a <a class="wu-link" href="files/parser.py">parser in Python</a>
					to automate the translation process and made a JSON mapping of translations. <br>
					&emsp; For loading data, we used JavaScript; this is in the beginning of our “script.js” file. 
					Specifically, we have JavaScript “Promises” that fetch from some URLs stored in GitHub pages. 
					<a class="wu-link" href="https://monicalin22.github.io/chinese-names/data/char_to_definition.json?fbclid=IwAR1t8CZZCd1DiENGbUfKxYLGTz29heCqs41kmdNllROJGE1ANbXoR3c1Q-s" 
					target=_blank>Click here for an example.</a><br>
					&emsp; Finally, for the visualizations, we originally built them in Observable Notebook using D3, 
					but we switched over to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla JS) in order to host on our own 
					website. We preferred the aesthetics of our own website, and thought that Vanilla JS was easier 
					to work with. We did not utilize any special code we found on the internet when creating our 
					visualizations. <br>
					&emsp; There are no performance issues that we are aware of.
					<br><br>
				<b>Discussion</b></br>
						&emsp; We believe that our final visual encoding and interaction design was generally quite 
						successful! We had many students come up to us during and after class to commend us on our 
						work and give positive reactions. In the end, we created visualizations that answered our initial 
						questions, satisfied our motivations, and tied together Chinese names and modern history.<br>
						&emsp; For the majority of our final visualizations, there was no confusion. We received 
						feedback from previous sessions in the semester that we implemented to curb any confusion, 
						i.e. our first visualization was originally condensed and hard to follow, but we expanded it and 
						added features to make it easier to read and interact with. Some viewers were also initially 
						confused by our second visualization and its intended main takeaway, but with the 
						accompanying captions/text, we hope that that is cleared up.<br>
						&emsp; Finally, for new insights, we learned about the true impact of history on the identity and 
						experience of Chinese people. Though we heard a lot about the Cultural Revolution as an 
						event, these visualizations have helped us personalize and individualize that historical 
						experience. Moreover, we learned about the prevalences of our own names. For the general 
						audience, we have given them an overview of Chinese history, which is often overlooked in 
						American schools, and hopefully piqued their interest in cultures vastly different from theirs. Our 
						visualizations serve as an interesting introduction to exploration of Chinese culture.
						<br><br>						
				<b>Future Work</b><br>
					&emsp; Regarding research, though we did have time to get a general overview of historical 
					events, we would like to research gender history and social history more in-depth. <br>
					&emsp; For our second visualization, we would like to make an accompanying visualization that 
					shows the top 50 characters per decade based on which decade was selected, rather than just 
					tracking the survivability of pre-1960s names. <br>
					&emsp; For our last visualization, we would like to allow the user to input multiple characters 
					and compare trends of all those selected side-by-side. We would also like to make the celebrity 
					names clickable and include more history regarding each celebrity’s name. <br>
					&emsp; Finally, we would like to do some user testing with our visualizations outside of class to 
					get opinions from people who may not be as familiar with our work.<br>
