		<h1>Mainland Chinese Names: Meaning, Gender, and Modern History</h1>
		<p>Monica Lin, Brian Ma, Jeffrey Luo, Yu-Ying Lee</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Example: 马绍恩
			The structure is [Family Name (马)] [Given Name (绍恩)]. The family name is inherited from the patriarch of a family, passed down through generations. It is usually a single character, but a few consist of two.
			
			The given name is chosen at birth as an individual’s personal identifier. It can have 1 or 2 characters. Usually, if a name has two characters, the second character is the "generation name", with siblings of a family sharing the same character (绍).
			If a person's given name is only a single character, it may indicate that they are an only child. However, this is only a guideline, and parents may name their only child a two character name if they prefer the meaning of the name with two characters.
			Characters in names also double as words, unlike what you see with English names; i.e. Bethany doesn’t mean anything, whereas chinese names may have very specific meanings.
			However, similar to English names, Chinese names may follow trends as various "styles" or "themes" go in and out of style.

		<h2>History</h2>
		Chinese names are composed of words with real meanings, parents tend to want to give names with pleasant meanings.
		Those who are more superstitious believe that names can determine one’s fate in life.
		Names encode wishes parents have for their children.
		Wishes, and thereby names, are surely affected by gender, historical events, and the overall attitude of society. 

		<h4>Notes</h4>
		Now, before we dive into exploring Chinese names throughout modern history, let us first note some important information.
		Our data is collected from Han Chinese in the People’s Republic of China (Mainland China). The names are split into 6 cohorts—pre-1960, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Before 1960, the names are for people who were alive. After, they are for all newborns in that decade.
		The data shows unique aspects of Mainland China’s historical context, events, and culture. Naming practices in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, and Chinese Diaspora, as well as non-Han ethnic groups in Mainland China are not reflected.

		<h4>The Visualisation</h4>
		<svg id="decade-rank-m"></svg><svg id="decade-rank-f"></svg>
		<p>Let's look at the top 100 names of each decade for each gender. This visualisation ranks each name vertically by decade, and tracks how its rank changes using a line. Each name is labelled at its peak ranking. You can hover your mouse over the labels and lines and see the meaning on the right. The colours represent the "theme" of the name. You can filter the themes by clicking on the squares on the right.
			Right now this looks very complicated, so let's investigate some of the main themes!</p>

		<h4>pre-1960</h4>
		<p>
		The years before the 1960's was characterised by revolutions and poverty. If you were born during the Boxer Rebellion (1900), you would experience the fall of China's last imperial
		dynasty (1911), the internal division and constant civil war of the Warlord Era (1912-1927), the partial unification by the Nationalists (1927), the creation of puppet states in the northwest by Japan (1931), and then a full invasion marking the start of World War II (1937).
		After the end of World War II, you would see a new Civil War erupt between the Nationalists and the Communists, leading to a Communist victory on the Mainland and the retreat of the Nationalists to Taiwan.
		You would have experienced Mao Zedong (毛泽东) proclaim the People’s Republic in Tiananmen Square and, finally, an end to civil war. 
		You would experience a series of collectivising reforms, but some, like the Great Leap Forward (1958), would lead to a famine that ultimately kills 15-55 million people (1959-1961).
		</p>
		<p>
		To say the people of China suffered greatly during this period would be an understatement. In addition to the death and suffering caused by civil wars and external invasion, China would experience 6 separate famines from 1900-1960. 
		The Zeitgeist of this era was very much a desire to see a better China. The parents named their children in hopes that they would grow up to live in, or to help build a peaceful, stable, and prosperous nation to live in.

		<h5>Female Names about Nation/National Recovery</h5>
		<svg id="decade-rank-f-nation"></svg>
		<p>Reflecting Gender attitudes at the time, female children were less expected to be concerned with affairs of the state.</p>

		<h4>1960s</h4>
		<p>
		The Great Chinese famine ended in 1961, and Mao's leadership took a back seat due to the failure of the Great Leap Forward.
		Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Premier Zhou Enlai took over direction of the country and adopted more pragmatic economic policies.
		Dissatisfied, Mao aimed to regain his preemience by launching the Cultural Revolution. This mass social movement aimed to return Communism and Maoism as the dominant ideology.
		A key idea of this movement was that the chaos and suffering of the previous decades was due to the flaws and weaknesses of tradition. To strengthen the nation, the country must
		cast away the past and agressively modernise into a Communist state. 
		As such, names relating to Communism and the Military became popular in this era.
