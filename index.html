			<h3>What's in a (Chinese) Name?</h3>
			<p>
			In English, names are used as identifiers. They can have some convoluted meanings attached
			to them (e.g., "Isabella" is the Spanish/Italian translation of
			"God is my oath"), but for the most part, they simply serve as identifiers. 
			<br><br>
			In Chinese, names are more than that. Not only do they serve as personal identifiers, 
			but each name also means something that every Chinese person is aware of  
			because in Chinese, names are made up of words/characters.
			<br><br>
			An example of a Chinese name is: 马绍恩. The structure is [Family Name (马)] 
			[Given Name (绍恩)]. The family name is inherited from the patriarch of a family, 
			passed down through generations. It usually consists of a single character, but 
			a small number consist of two.
			<br><br>
			The given name is chosen at birth as an individual’s personal identifier. 
			It can consist of one or two characters. Usually, if a name has two characters, 
			the second is the "generation name", which siblings of a family share 
			(绍 in the example above). If a person's given name is only a single character, 
			it may indicate that they are an only child, but parents 
			might still give their only child a two character name if they 
			prefer the meaning of it.
			<br><br>
			In the example name above, "马" means "horse", "绍" means "to continue/carry on", 
			and "恩" means "grace/kindness"; (family name, first character of given 
			name, and second character of given name respectively.)
			<br><br>
			<b>Because Chinese names have such meanings, naming requires great care.
			Parents tend to want to give names with pleasant meanings, eliminating vulgar and negative words from 
			the naming vocabulary. Some parents even wish to bestow a “good” name because Chinese 
			superstition suggests that a name can determine one’s fate in life.
			As such, names encode the wishes parents have for their children. </b>
			So, what are these wishes? To uncover more about this relationship, 
			we created the data visualizations below. We discovered that names and 
			their associated sentiments change depending on the gender of a newborn and 
			the historical period in which they were born.
			</p>
			<h3>Important Notes</h3>
			<p>Before we dive into exploring Chinese names throughout modern history, 
			we must share a few important notes about our work.
			The data represents only Han Chinese names from the People’s Republic of China 
			(Mainland China). The names are split into 6 cohorts: pre-1960, 1960s, 1970s, 
			1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The pre-1960 names are of those who were alive at the time, 
			and after that, they are of all newborns in a given decade.
			The data contains unique aspects of Mainland China’s historical context, events, and 
			culture, but naming practices in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, the Chinese Diaspora, 
			and non-Han ethnic groups in Mainland China are not reflected.
			<br><br>
			Additionally, we did some work to make the data more accessible. 
			First, we translated 500+ individual names by hand and catagorized them into themes. 
			Then, to verify validity, two members of the team cross-checked one another's translations and 
			categorization. Though every Chinese character is very rich in meaning and nuance, we did 
			our very best to convey them in English. We hope that the translations will be insightful 
			and interesting to you!
			</p>
			<h4>The Impact of History on Chinese Names</h4>
			<p>
			The characters of Chinese names were impacted by the historical contexts 
			during which they were given, and our first visualizations take a deeper look 
			at this relationship between history and given names.<br><br>
			First, we present a visualization and a caption describing how to read it; then, we discuss 
			the significance of historical periods in China from pre-1960s to the 2000s,
			and break down the main takeaways of the initial visualization.

		<h3>Before 1960</h3>
		<p>
			<b>The years before the 1960s were characterized by revolutions, poverty, and instability.</b><br><br>
			If you were born during this period, you would have experienced the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, the fall of China's 
			last imperial dynasty in 1911, the internal division and constant civil war of the Warlord Era 
			from 1912 to 1927, the partial unification by Nationalists in 1927, the creation of puppet 
			states in the northwest by Japan in 1931, and a full invasian marking the start of World War II 
			in 1937. After World War II ended, you would have experienced the eruption of a civil war 
			between the Nationalists and the Communists, which saw the Communists win on the Mainland, pushing 
			the Nationalists to retreat to Taiwan. You would have also witnessed Mao Zedong (毛泽东) proclaim 
			the People's Republic in Tiananmen Square, bringing about the end of a civil war.
			All throughout, you would have experienced a series of collectivizing reforms, 
			but some, like the Great Leap Forward (1958), led to a famine that ultimately killed 15-55 
			million people from 1959 to 1961.<br><br>
			To say the people of China suffered greatly during this period would be an understatement. 
			In addition to the death and suffering caused by civil wars and external invasion, 
			China experienced 6 separate famines from 1900-1960. <br><br>
			<b>The zeitgest of this era was very much a desire to see a better China as the China that parents 
			knew was desolate and riddled with hardship. As such, parents named their children in hopes that 
			they would grow up in and help build a more peaceful, stable, and prosperous nation.</b>

			<h3>The 1960s and 1970s</h3>
			<p>In 1961, the Great Chinese Famine ended, and Mao's leadership took a backseat 
				due to the failure of the Great Leap Forward. Political leaders Liu Shaoqi (刘少奇), 
				Deng Xiaoping (邓小平), and Premier Zhou Enlai (周恩来) began directing the country, 
				adopting more pragmatic and open economic policies. <br><br>
				Dissatisfied, Mao attempted to regain his preeminence by launching the Cultural Revolution 
				in 1966. This mass social movement aimed to reinstate Communism/Maoism as the dominant 
				ideology. A key idea of this movement was that the chaos and suffering 
				of previous decades could be attributed to the flaws and weaknesses of tradition. 
				To strengthen the nation, the country must cast away the past and aggressively modernize 
				into a Communist state.<br><br>
				<b>As a result, names related to Communism and the military became rather popular during 
				this era.</b><br><br>
				In the mid-1970s, Deng Xiaopeng brought about some limited economic reforms, but the 
				Cultural Revolution continued until the death of Mao in 1976. Afterwards came an 
				official repudiation of the Cultural Revolution and its ideals, as well as a 
				reduction of ideological fervor among the population of Mainland China.

		<h3>1980s</h3>
		<p>
		The 1980s in China was a period of Reform. The collectivising policies instituded in the previous decades were dismantled (1979-1982), and private enterprises were allowed (1985).
		The "One Child Policy" (1979) was just introduced, and its effects can be seen in this decade and after. In 3 character Chinese names, the second character usually represents the "generation", with
		sibling of the same generation sharing the same second character. Since the new policy meant that only childs became more common, many parents chose to not give a generation name to their child, leading to single character names becoming popular.

		<h3>1990s to 2000s</h3>
		<p>
		Deng's economic reforms during the 1980's bore fruit and resulted in massive economic growth, stability and prosperity for Chinese people. Parents of this era were no longer so concerned with ideology and national stability, and were more able to focus on their child's well being.
		In this era, you see more names relating to Happiness and Family, as well as more of a focus onto Intelligence.
		Gradual improvements in gender attitudes can also be seen, as the names relating to Intelligence increases for both genders.
