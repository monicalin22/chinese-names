			<h3>What's in a (Chinese) Name?</h3>
			<p>
			In English, names are used as identifiers. They can have some convoluted meanings attached
			to them (e.g., "Isabella" is the Spanish/Italian translation of
			"God is my oath"), but for the most part, they simply serve as identifiers. 
			<br><br>
			In Chinese, names are more than that. Not only do they serve as personal identifiers, 
			but each name also means something that every Chinese person is aware of  
			because in Chinese, names are made up of words/characters.
			<br><br>
			An example of a Chinese name is: 马绍恩. The structure is [Family Name (马)] 
			[Given Name (绍恩)]. The family name is inherited from the patriarch of a family, 
			passed down through generations. It usually consists of a single character, but 
			a small number consist of two.
			<br><br>
			The given name is chosen at birth as an individual’s personal identifier. 
			It can consist of one or two characters. Usually, if a name has two characters, 
			the second is the "generation name", which siblings of a family share 
			(绍 in the example above). If a person's given name is only a single character, 
			it may indicate that they are an only child, but parents 
			might still give their only child a two-character name if they 
			prefer the meaning of it.
			<br><br>
			In the example name above, "马" means "horse", "绍" means "to continue/carry on", 
			and "恩" means "grace/kindness"; (family name, first character of given 
			name, and second character of given name respectively.) This specific name was intended to have
			Christian undertones, as the parents had just converted to Christianity when this person was born.
			<br><br>
			<b>Because Chinese names have such meanings, naming requires great care.
			Parents tend to want to give names with pleasant meanings, eliminating vulgar and negative words from 
			the naming vocabulary. Some parents even wish to bestow a “good” name because Chinese 
			superstition suggests that a name can determine one’s fate in life.
			As such, names encode the wishes parents have for their children. </b>
			So, what are these wishes? To uncover more about this relationship, 
			we created the data visualizations below. We discovered that names and 
			their associated sentiments change depending on the gender of a newborn and 
			the historical period in which they were born.

			In this article, you will see general trends in naming practices, but with uncountable possible combinations of characters to form names, these names also reflect very individual experiences and hopes of parents.
			The visualisations below, despite showing the most popular names, only display a minority of the population. Most Chinese people you meet will have different names, each reflecting the unique and individual life experiences of the parents.   
			</p>
			<h3>Important Notes</h3>
			<p>Before we dive into exploring Chinese names throughout modern history, 
			we must share a few important notes about our work.
			The data represents only Han Chinese names from the People’s Republic of China 
			(Mainland China). The names are split into 6 cohorts: pre-1960, 1960s, 1970s, 
			1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The pre-1960 names are of those who were alive at the time, 
			and after that, they are of all newborns in a given decade.
			The data contains unique aspects of Mainland China’s historical context, events, and 
			culture, but naming practices in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, the Chinese Diaspora, 
			and non-Han ethnic groups in Mainland China are not reflected.
			<br><br>
			Additionally, we did some work to make the data more accessible. 
			First, we translated 500+ individual names by hand and catagorized them into themes. 
			Then, to verify validity, two members of the team cross-checked one another's translations and 
			categorization. Though every Chinese character is very rich in meaning and nuance, we did 
			our very best to convey them in English. We hope that the translations will be insightful 
			and interesting to you!
			</p>
			<h4>The Impact of History on Chinese Names</h4>
			<p>
			The characters of Chinese names were impacted by the historical contexts 
			during which they were given, and our first visualizations take a deeper look 
			at this relationship between history and given names.<br><br>
			First, we present a visualization and a caption describing how to read it; then, we discuss 
			the significance of historical periods in China from pre-1960s to the 2000s,
			and break down the main takeaways of the initial visualization.

		<h3>Before 1960</h3>
		<p>
			<b>The years before the 1960s were characterized by revolution, poverty, and instability.</b><br><br>
			If you were born during this period, you would have experienced the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, the 
			fall of China's 
			last imperial dynasty in 1911, the internal division and constant civil war of the Warlord Era 
			from 1912 to 1927, a partial unification by Nationalists in 1927, the creation of puppet 
			states in the northwest by Japan in 1931, and a brutal, full-scale invasian by Japan 
			that marked the start of World War II for China in 1937. After World War II ended, 
			you would have experienced the eruption of a civil war 
			between the Nationalists and the Communists, which saw the Communists win on the Mainland, pushing 
			the Nationalists to retreat to Taiwan. You would have also witnessed Mao Zedong (毛泽东) proclaim 
			the People's Republic in Tiananmen Square, bringing about the end of a civil war but a more 
			tumultuous future.
			Under Mao, you would have experienced a series of collectivizing reforms, 
			but some, like the Great Leap Forward (1958), led to a famine that ultimately killed 
			an estimated 15 to 55 
			million people from 1959 to 1961.<br><br>
			To say the people of China suffered greatly during this period would be an understatement. 
			In addition to the death and suffering caused by civil wars and external invasion, 
			China experienced 6 separate famines from 1900-1960. <br><br>
			<b>The zeitgest of this era was very much a desire to see a better China as the one that parents 
			knew was desolate and riddled with hardship. As such, parents named their children in the hope that 
			they would grow up in and help build a more peaceful, stable, and prosperous China.</b>

			<h3>The 1960s and 1970s</h3>
			<p>In 1961, the Great Chinese Famine ended, and Mao's leadership took a backseat 
				due to the failure of the Great Leap Forward. Political leaders Liu Shaoqi (刘少奇), 
				Deng Xiaoping (邓小平), and Premier Zhou Enlai (周恩来) laid a heavier hand in 
				directing the country, adopting more pragmatic and open economic policies. <br><br>
				Dissatisfied, Mao attempted to regain his preeminence by launching the Cultural Revolution 
				in 1966. This mass social movement aimed to reinstate Communism/Maoism as the dominant 
				ideology. A key idea of this movement was that the chaos and suffering 
				of previous decades could be attributed to the flaws and weaknesses of "tradition";  
				To strengthen the nation, the country must cast away the past, often violently, 
				and aggressively modernize into a Communist state.<br><br>
				<b>As a result, names related to Communism, such those including the color red and those 
				related to military terminology, became rather popular during this era.</b><br><br>
				In the mid-1970s, Deng Xiaopeng brought about some limited economic reforms, but the 
				Cultural Revolution continued until the death of Mao in 1976. Afterwards came an 
				official repudiation of the Cultural Revolution and its ideals, as well as a 
				reduction of ideological fervor among the individuals of Mainland China.

			During the 1960s and 1970s, names related to military terminology became 
			especially popular for male newborns. In fact, many made top rankings. <br><br>
			For female newborns, military names were not at all popular, reflecting the 
			gender attitudes of the time as military matters were seen as masculine. There was 
			an increase in popularity, though, for names containing the word, "red." (Red is a color 
			closely associated with Communism, and the main color of the flag that was 
			raised when the People's Republic of China was established.)

			<h3>The 1980s</h3>
			<p>In China, the 1980s was a decade of reform. 
				The collectivizing policies instituted in previous decades 
				were dismantled between 1979 and 1982. In 1985, private enterprises were 
				allowed to form. <br><br>
				The "One Child Policy" was just introduced in 1979, and its effects were most pertinent 
				in this decade and the decades after. As mentioned in the introduction, in Chinese names 
				with three characters, the second is the "generation name", with siblings of the same 
				generation sharing that same second character. <b>The new policy meant that parents could 
				only have a single child, so many parents chose to not give a generation name, resulting in 
				the rise of single-character names.</b>

				<b>As such, parents of this era were no longer as concerned with ideology and

		<p class="caption">In general, the top 50 characters in the given names of each decade

			Additionally, the average warmth and competence of given names 
			increases throughout the decades, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. 
			This change can be explained in our analysis of this 
			era as names related to "Joy & Happiness", "Family", and "Intelligence" increased in 
			popularity. These kinds of names definitely contain words that are warmer/more competent.
			<br><br>
			Finally, though average warmth of given characters among male and female newborns stays 
			relatively similar throughout the decades, on average, characters given to males for 
			their names are more competent. The gap increases for average competence between male and 
			female names in the 1990s and 2000s, displaying some biases towards gender, i.e. that 
			parents had higher hopes for the competence of male children.<br><br>
